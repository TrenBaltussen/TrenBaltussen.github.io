Tren Baltussen received the M.Sc. degree (cum laude) in Systems and Control from the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) in 2024. His M.Sc. thesis was on learning-based control methods for motion planning of autonomous vehicles. He is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree in the Control Systems Technology group with the Department of Mechanical Engineering at TU/e. His research interests include model predictive control of autonomous systems subject to uncertainty as well as safe, learning-based control methods with a particular focus on autonomous vehicles.
