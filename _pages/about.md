I received the M.Sc. degree (cum laude) in Systems and Control from the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) in 2024. My M.Sc. thesis was on learning-based control methods for motion planning of autonomous vehicles. I am currently working towards the Ph.D. degree in the Control Systems Technology group with the Department of Mechanical Engineering at TU/e under the supervision of professor Maurice Heemels and professor Alexander Katriniok. My research interests include model predictive control (MPC) of autonomous systems subject to uncertainty and dual control theory.
